There are four distinct parts to this project, these are as follows:

- The Spring based API Server
- The Windows Desktop Client
- The Website
- The automatic file removal script.

The API Server, Website and File Removal Script do not require you to manually run them. These are provided
already configured running at (except the removal script which runs on the server, but is not accessible):

Website: http://tfhs.ddns.net
API: http://tfhs.ddns.net:8080

The desktop client is preconfigured to use the remote resources and runs standalone on a user’s system. This
client allows one to interact with the Temporary File Upload System and do various things such as register, 
login, and upload files.

A built release version of the desktop client is provided within the repository and if ready to run. In order
to run it do the following:

1) Locate the /bin directory in the same folder as this text document and open it.
2) Locate the /TFHS Windows Client directory in the /bin directory and open it.
3) Double click the "TFHS Windows Client.exe" executable in order to start the program.
4) Once started the program will open itself in the system tray as an icon. To interact with the program,
   right click this icon for various menu options.

That should be all there is to running the program. To close it right click the icon and select exit,
otherwise leave it open in your system tray.
