All project source code resides within the src/ directory in the same directory as this text file. Within
the src/ folder there are four more folders, each one representing separate individual parts of the project.

There parts do not directly interact with each other on a code level, they can be better looked at as sort of
sub-projects that together provide all the needed features of the Temporary File Upload System.

The directories and their contents are described below:

/src/ApiServer - This directory contains all the Java/Spring code that forms the backbone of the project, the API.
                 This is the code that directly interacts with the database and handles all user, tracking and 
                 file upload functions.

/src/FileTrimmer - This directory contains a single Python script, trim.py. This script runs as a cron job on
                   on the server and is responsible for removing old files and changing their status in the
                   database to make them not show up in lists of available files.

/src/WebPortal - This directory contains all the code related to the website/web portal. It is used for our
                 single page homepage and lists any and all available public files for download. It also allows
                 users to download the Windows Client.

/src/WindowsClient - The Windows Client is a desktop piece of software which lives in the system tray. This software
                     directly communicates with the API server and is what allows users to register, login and
                     upload files. The Windows client relies totally on the API server for almost all of its
                     functionality.
